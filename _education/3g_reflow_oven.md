### What is a re-flow oven
The oven is suitable for fast soldering of entire boards in one go when working with so-called surface mounted devices (SMD).
Typically they are used for very small electronic components, as they are processed in the automated production of industrial robots.
Soldering SMDs by hand is hard and time-staking. It can be done in 5-10 mins with the reflow oven.

### Working with re-flow oven

This process starts once the components are physically placed on the PCB board and glued with the help of thermal paste (see step before).

The oven has four pre-programmed temperature curves (waves). You choose the curve which fits to your solder material and the thermal limits of the components. For this purpose, we have chosen curve 2 which fits best to our requirements.

Once the casing is closed and the oven is started, you can follow the temperature curve to know the status of the process. It typically took us 7 minutes.

### Optical evaluation of finished board.

Since the electronic components were seated manually on the PCB there is a high probability of human error. The component was put under optical evaluation using a microscope to check displaced contacts or if the pins are in line with the sockets.

If an error was found, the electronic component was removed with a soldering gun and soldered in an appropriate position.
