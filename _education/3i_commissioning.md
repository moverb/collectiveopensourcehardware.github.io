Before you can flash the board, you should perform basic checks of the soldering process and the hardware.

## Solder bridges

You should carefully check if there are no solder bridges between any pins. Especially the microcontroller with its small pin pitch is susceptible to have some unwanted connections between pins.

Ideally, you use a magnifying glass or a microscope to check the board.

If you identify any solder bridges, use the desoldering braid to remove the bridges as shown in the following picture.

 Ideally, you use a soldering tip with high mass and high temperature setting (around 400 Â°C) to heat up the solder quickly through the desoldering braid. You should not touch the joint with the soldering iron for too long to prevent transfering to much heat onto the chip.

 For lead-free solder, higher temperature settings might be needed. Adding a little bit of leaded solder makes it easier to remove the solder bridges.

### Power supply testing

After all solder bridges have been removed and the presence of all parts is checked the PCB can be powered.

If the PCB has a USB connector, it is probably the easiest way to power the board. If existing, a power LED should indicate the functionality of the board. Libre Solar boards, however, only contain LEDs which can be switched on or off by the microcontroller. The LEDs work only after flashing the firmware.

Without a LED as indicator, you need a multimeter to check if the energy supply is working. It can be tested by screening the voltage of the capacitors close to the microcontroller which should be at 3.3V. An example is shown in the following picture:

You can use the schematic and the board files of the specific device to find additional points to test for a detailed analysis.

If the measured voltage at the capacitor is not correct there probably is an error on the PCB (e.g. short sircuit).

Unfortunately, a short circuit cannot be detected easily with a multimeter. You might touch the PCB to detect if some parts get hot and look for the short circuit close to the hot parts.

If existing, you can look at the PCB using a thermal camera to detect hot spots with short circuits.

If there is a short circuit you can see a red area in the thermal camera. This indicates a high current flow which heats the PCB in that area.
