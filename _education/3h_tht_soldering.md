**Caution:** use handgloves during the time of usage.

On the following figure you can see the PCB with and without THT (**T**hrough **H**ole **T**echnique) parts.

## Identifying the irregularities
In the picture shown below the identified displaced components will lead to component malfunction and short-circuits. The magnifying lens is used to thoroughly check if there are parts on the board with irregularities.

## Removing the irregularities with heat gun
Using the heat gun, the wrong soldering is removed on the applied area with a heat gun. A soldering wick can also be used to desolder the joints.

## Soldering with rosin core and soldering wick
After the components are placed correctly and soldered with the help of rosin core, soldering wick can be used to avoid contacts between successive pins.

Now it goes to the next stage of commissioning and testing, where thorough check is done on electrical contacts and short circuits.
